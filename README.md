## Elevator Pitch

The quarantine enacted by COVID caused us to lose connection with many of our social groups making it difficult to get together and play games.
Many of our friends may have moved or decided to stay in a self quarantine with the pandemic still in full swing. As a result, they find themselves
without anyone to play or discuss one of their favorite hobbies, board games! We created a social platform that will allow this individual to connect
with other board game enthusiasts on games they both enjoy or discover new games together. They will be able to find, follow, and chat with like minded individuals 
in the board game community to create life long connections!

## User Story

    AS an avid board game enthusiast
    I WANT an online social platform for board games
    SO THAT I can connect with the board game community, rank and discover new board games, and set up game nights with friends. 

## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN the find-my-boards home page
    THEN I am  presented with the title of the application, a short description, the current top 10 list of user rated board games, and a link to login or create a new account
    WHEN I click on the login link
    THEN I am directed to either login or create my account( links will be seperate pages)
    WHEN I log into my profile
    THEN I am presented with a dashboard that includes my favorite games and friends list as well as search functions for finding new games and friends.
    WHEN I use the board game search function
    THEN I can enter board game parameters such as title, catagory or number of players and be presented with a list of matching games 
    WHEN I select a board game
    THEN I am presented with the game description, a way to make comments, read comments and view the current ratings of the game based on user feedback
    WHEN I navigate to the friends list
    THEN I am redirected to a page that allows me to search for a username or filter for users based on their friends list
    WHEN I select a user from the community
    THEN I am able to view the user's profile, add them to my friends list(follow), see their favorite games and view the history of their posted comments.
